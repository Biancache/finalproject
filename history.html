        <div class="title">Brandy Melville</div>
        <p>
            Brandy Melville's entrance into the Chinese fashion market sparked a mix of responses due to its "One Size Fits All" policy. This policy, while criticized in the U.S. for promoting unrealistic body stereotypes and lacking inclusivity, found a different reception in China. Brandy Melville's style, characterized by crop tops, plaid skirts, and slim jeans, became highly popular among young Chinese girls and even celebrities. The brand was initially celebrated for introducing new fashion norms and encouraging young women to confidently show their bodies rather than hiding them under loose clothing. This shift was seen as a step forward in a society where conservative fashion norms had long prevailed, such as debates over appropriate skirt lengths and the acceptance of crop tops and tank tops. </p>
            <br>
            <p>However, the "One Size Fits All" policy did not come without criticism in China. Many noted the unrealistic body proportions suggested by the brand's sizing chart, and there was awareness of the negative implications of this sizing approach. Despite these concerns, the general attitude in China seemed to be more accepting of the brand's limited sizing, with a focus on individual choice and the idea that if someone doesn't like the style or size, they can simply choose not to buy it. </p>
            <br>
            <p> In contrast to the U.S. where body positivity promotes self-acceptance, in China, self-love is often interpreted as striving for continuous improvement, including achieving a body type that fits into Brandy Melville's standards. This difference in cultural perspective on body image and fashion norms highlights the complex ways in which global brands like Brandy Melville intersect with local attitudes and practices </p>

        <div class="title">Lululemon have big size model</div>
        <p>
            Lululemon's recent initiatives in promoting body inclusivity have garnered mixed reactions. The brand
            appointed ultramarathoner Mirna Valerio, known for her blog "Fat Girl Running," as a new ambassador to front
            its "Feel Closer to Your Run" campaign. Valerio's involvement is aimed at representing runners with body
            types often overlooked in the fitness space. She expressed hope that her participation would empower people
            who have felt excluded by activities like running and inspire brands to offer better quality gear for bigger
            bodies. Valerio emphasized the need for apparel that fits all body types, functional, well-made, and
            available in diverse colors and styles.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In a separate effort towards inclusivity, Lululemon announced that it would offer six of its core styles in extended sizes, ranging from 0-20. This decision was part of the brand's journey towards inclusion, recognizing the need for a brand that accepts all body types. However, this announcement has been met with mixed reactions due to Lululemon's past controversies regarding exclusionary sizes and body shaming. Critics noted that the extension to size 20 is considerably lacking in true size inclusion, as it still excludes many shoppers who need sizes larger than 20. The limited extension and the choice of offering these extended sizes primarily in black were seen as insufficient steps towards real inclusivity.</p>
            <br>
            <p>These events reflect the ongoing challenges in the fashion industry to fully embrace body diversity and inclusivity. While steps like appointing diverse ambassadors and extending size ranges are positive, they also highlight the need for more comprehensive and authentic representation of all body types in fashion.</p>

        <div class="title">Philipp Plein Controversy</div>
        <p>
            German fashion designer Philipp Plein faced accusations of body-shaming from Brazilian model Gizele Oliveira. During a fitting for a fashion show, Oliveira, who is a size 4, was put in a dress that was too small and then told she should leave as all the dresses were the same size, which catered to sizes 0 to 2. Despite her previous experience and status in the industry, she felt marginalized due to not fitting the immediate size expectations of the brand. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Gizele Oliveira used TikTok to reveal her negative experience with fashion designer Plein, highlighting how he kept her and other models waiting for over three hours for a supposed 30-minute fitting. In her series, she expressed frustration over the frequent body-shaming models endure, citing her own experience of being criticized for her weight. Other models resonated with her story, sharing their own experiences of humiliation and body-shaming in the industry. These accounts included being embarrassed for not fitting into garments, pressure to maintain unrealistically small sizes, and emotional distress caused by such incidents. The shared stories underscore a broader issue of body-shaming and unrealistic beauty standards in the modeling world.
